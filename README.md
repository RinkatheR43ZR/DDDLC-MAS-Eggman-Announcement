# DDDLC-MAS-Eggman-Announcement
A small mod that lets Monika talk about the copypasta meme, "Eggman's Announcement".

Here's how you add submods to Monika After Story:

1. Download the file.
2. Go to the "game" folder of the Monika After Story mod.
3. Create a new folder called "submods". If you already have a "submods" folder, simply place it into the folder.

Aaand... That's it!

I hope you enjoy this silly submod I made!

Love for the MAS community,
Rinka
